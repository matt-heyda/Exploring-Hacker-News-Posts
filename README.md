# Exploring Hacker News Posts

This project is an exploration of submissions made on the Hacker News website. The submissions of interest are the ones that begin with the titles 'Show HN' and 'Ask HN'. 'Show HN' posts are submitted to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or, simply, something interesting. While 'Ask HN' submissions ask the community a specific question.

This project compares these two types of posts to determine:

* Do 'Ask HN' or 'Show HN' receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?


### Skills Demonstrated:
* How to work with strings
* Object-oriented programming
* Dates and times
